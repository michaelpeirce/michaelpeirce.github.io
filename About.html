  <h3>About</h3>
  <h4>Get to know ME</h4>
  <p>Graduating in a humanities subject may not seem like the typical background of your average creative technologist. Despite this, that is precisely where I was at before coming to UWE to study an MSc in Creative Technology. Technology and its creative applications were always something that I maintained an interest in alongside my time studying for a BA at the University of Exeter and I feel that my somewhat unique background has only served to help me offer fresh and different perspectives on creating with tech. With extensive experience articulating my ideas and theories in a written format, I am able to analyse my own work and creations to the highest degree. I continue to be fascinated and excited by ways in which to use technology to express myself and fulfill the needs of whoever I am working for or with. I have skills in web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, alongside experience in sound engineering and production, as well as knowledge of OpenFrameworks in C++. I specialise in creating exciting and fun multimedia installations primarily using visuals and audio for a variety of contexts and purposes such as educational, interactive exhibits and also design prototyping for projects that will scale up.  </p>
<h5>Interests outside of Technology</h5>
<p>Outside of the world of tech I am nevertheless constantly working to improve in other aspects of my life. Music is another big interest of mine and I am an avid guitarist and pianist with experience composing and writing music both by hand and using notation software such as Sibellius. I enjoy drawing although this is still something I have only really just begun to explore! I am a fan of artists who use a range of different mediums, Casey Reas being one from the digital world that springs to mind and I love both art and music produced using generative processes and systems. Trying to stay active has also been an important part of my life, particularly when a lot of my time is spent infront of a computer or musical instrument of some sort and I am a frequent gym-goer as well as footballer, playing tennis on occasion also. I like to read, particularly autobiographies about artists and musicians I am a fan of from across history. </p>
