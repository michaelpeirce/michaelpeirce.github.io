    <figcaption>Visa Express</figcaption>
    <p> Visa Express is my most recent collaborative project with colleagues at UWE. The concept behind Visa Express is to convey a message about freedom of movement via video documentation of a prototype multimedia installation involving elements of a Visa application process. </p>

  <figcaption>Generative Squares</figcaption>
  <p> Generative Squares is one of my first forays into creating generative art in C++ using OpenFrameworks. The system I created generates a pattern of interlinking, random-sized squares which alternate between the colours red and blue and move towards the middle of the screen where the pattern stops. This application also provided my personal branding logo as can be seen at the top of this page!</p>

  <figcaption>Streets of Hostility</figcaption>
  <p> Streets of Hostility was the name of an audio-visual installation prototype which was created in order to raise awareness of rough sleepers in Bristol and their struggle with their environment, namely one dominated by hostile architecture. The project was created in conjunction with the organisation known as the People's Republic of Stokes Croft(PRSC) in Bristol.</p>
